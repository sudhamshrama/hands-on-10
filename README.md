Red-Black Trees and AVL Trees are both types of balanced binary search trees that ensure efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations by maintaining balance in different ways.

### Red-Black Trees:
- Red-Black Trees use colors (red and black) and specific rules to keep the tree balanced.
- Rules include the root being black, red nodes not having red children, and maintaining the same number of black nodes on all paths.
- Balancing operations involve rotations and color adjustments to uphold these rules.
- Red-Black Trees offer a good balance between efficiency and simplicity in maintaining balance.

### AVL Trees:
- AVL Trees maintain balance by ensuring that the height difference between left and right subtrees of each node is at most 1.
- Rotations are performed to rebalance the tree when the height difference violates the AVL property.
- AVL Trees provide stricter balance guarantees compared to Red-Black Trees, potentially leading to faster search times.
- The height balance in AVL Trees helps keep the tree relatively compact, reducing the worst-case time complexity of operations.

### Binary Search Tree:
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a hierarchical data structure that maintains an ordering property, making search operations efficient by comparing values to decide the direction of traversal.
